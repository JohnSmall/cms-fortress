Add this in an initializer:\r\n\r\n    Cms::Fortress.configure do |config|\r\n      config.settings_resources << {\r\n        :name => 'my_role_detail',\r\n        :title => 'i18n.label.title', # this is passed to the t() function - can be plain text\r\n        :path => 'admin_my_role_details_path'\r\n      }\r\n      # the other two lists are \"content_resources\" and \"design_resources\"\r\n    end\r\n\r\nThe path is eval'd at runtime, so you can use Rails helper methods such as\r\n+current_user+ or <tt>@site</tt> in it. If the result is nil, the link will not show up\r\nin the left nav bar.\r\n\r\n3: Restart the server. Go into each Role you have defined and click\r\n\"Load New Roles\". Voila!\r\n\r\n###  Other configuration\r\n\r\nYou can turn off page workflow or page caching via configuration:\r\n\r\n    Cms::Fortress.configure do |config|\r\n      config.theme = :wide\r\n      config.enable_page_workflow = false\r\n      config.enable_page_caching = false\r\n    end\r\n\r\n###  Wide Theme\r\nWith wide theme, the layout and menus are being compacted so that you have all the area for authoring.  Files are also being nicely integrated to the WYSIWYG editor (tinymce).\r\nBelow are the fetures for wide theme:\r\n\r\n* Compact Layout and Menus\r\n* Responsive Layout\r\n* Fullcreen Editing\r\n* Integrated image file attachement\r\n* Integrated video file attachment\r\n* Integrated link file attachement\r\n\r\n![](http://raw.github.com/melvinsembrano/cms-fortress/master/docs/screens/compact-layout-01.png)\r\n\r\n![](http://raw.github.com/melvinsembrano/cms-fortress/master/docs/screens/files-integration-02.png)\r\n\r\n###  TODO: More customization documents and sample\r\n\r\nFor more Comfortable Mexican Sofa awesomeness visit the wiki page here https://github.com/comfy/comfortable-mexican-sofa/wiki\r\n\r\n## Contributing to cms-fortress\r\n\r\n* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.\r\n* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.\r\n* Fork the project.\r\n* Start a feature/bugfix branch.\r\n* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.\r\n* Make sure to add tests for it.
